### Step 1: Prepare Repository

cd C:\Users\Denny\ai-training-center

# Initialize git (if not done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial AI Training Center setup"
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Create new repo on GitHub first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/ai-training-center.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy on Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose `ai-training-center` repository
5. Railway will auto-detect Next.js

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard → Variables tab:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here
```

### Step 5: Get Your URL

Railway will provide a URL like: `https://ai-training-center-production.up.railway.app`

## 📱 For Demo Tomorrow

### Recommended Setup:

1. **Deploy to Railway** (for professional URL)
2. **Use localStorage** (works perfectly for demo)
3. **Add OPENAI_API_KEY** (for AI customer simulation)
4. **Prepare sample data** (create 2-3 training scenarios beforehand)

### Demo Tips:

1. Pre-load some training data in localStorage
2. Have 1-2 roleplay scenarios ready
3. Explain: "Using browser storage for demo speed, will add database for team use"
4. Show the AI customer simulation in action
5. Demonstrate the knowledge management

## 🔮 Future: Add Supabase (30 mins)

When client approves and wants multi-user:

1. Create Supabase project
2. Run migrations (will provide SQL)
3. Add Supabase env vars
4. App automatically switches to database
5. Redeploy

No code changes needed - storage layer is abstracted!
