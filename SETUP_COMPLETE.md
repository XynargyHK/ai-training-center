## 🎯 Demo Checklist

Before demo:
- [ ] Run `npm run dev`
- [ ] Add sample knowledge entries
- [ ] Create 1-2 roleplay scenarios
- [ ] Test AI customer simulation
- [ ] Prepare talking points

During demo:
- [ ] Show knowledge management

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: npm run dev fails
```bash
npm install --force
npm run dev
```

### Issue: AI customer doesn't respond
- Check .env.local has OPENAI_API_KEY
- Restart dev server

### Issue: Data disappeared
- localStorage clears with browser cache
- This is why production needs database!
